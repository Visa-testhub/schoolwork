Once you have the hosts file open you'll see most default text is comments, those lines beginning with
the pound (#) sign. After making changes to your hosts file, consider inserting your own comments
so you’ll know what the entries are for.

Inserting a redirect into the hosts file is simple.
Just enter the IP address of the desired server or host, leave a single space, 
and then enter the domain or hostname you want to point to that IP. 
Enter only one redirect per line.

When redirecting a real website URL, you should include one redirect with the www 
and another without, to ensure both will be redirected to your desired IP.
