This project is introduction to graphical drawing.
The assignment is in the pdf file.
You can use this program by executing the program with the different test maps.
This program is made with and for mac.

Requirements for program to work.
- Minilibx library -lmlx and its headerfile mlx.h
- X11 library -lX11 and -lxext and their include files
- Frameworks OpenGL and Appkit

Minilibx can be made with make command in minilibx directory.
After that, the header file "mlx.h" can be moved to /usr/local/include ,
and the libmlx.a to /usr/local/lib.

If you have linux system, the program should work if you can find the right, 
place for the minilibx, but I haven't gotten a chance to test it myself.
