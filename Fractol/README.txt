Fractol project focuses on honing skills on schools own graphical library, Minilibx,
discovering some uses for complex numbers and consept of optimization on computer graphics.

I tought this was great opportunity to learn simple use of multithreading as a way of
making the program faster, and it worked like a charm. As this program is noticeably
faster with multithreading.

Do a make in the Fractol folder to compile the program and the minilibx library.
Minilibx requires following to work.
- X11 and xextension library -lXext -lX11 in /usr/X11/lib
- X11 librarys includes in /usr/local/include/X11
- Frameworks OpenGL and Appkit

This project is made with macOS Catalina and is not tested in any other device,
but if all the requiremets are fulfilled it should work.
