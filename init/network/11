Network Address Translation (NAT)

To access the Internet, one public IP address is needed, but we can use a 
private IP address in our private network. 
The idea of NAT is to allow multiple devices to access the Internet through a single public address. 
To achieve this, the translation of private IP address to a public IP address is required. 
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address 
is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to 
provide Internet access to the local hosts. 
Also, it does the translation of port numbers i.e. masks the port number of the host 
with another port number, in the packet that will be routed to the destination. 
It then makes the corresponding entries of IP address and port number in the NAT table. 
NAT generally operates on router or firewall.

Network Address Translation (NAT) working â€“

Generally, the border router is configured for NAT i.e the router which has one interface
 in local (inside) network and one interface in the global (outside) network. 
When a packet traverse outside the local (inside) network, 
then NAT converts that local (private) IP address to a global (public) IP address. 
When a packet enters the local network, 
the global (public) IP address is converted to a local (private) IP address.

so in short you can use nslookup for the ip address after your own address and
find the name nat.hive.fi. from there
